Create a folder e.g., data_penn_fudan with Color, GroundTruth and feat_superpixels. Make sure file names are consistent in Color and Groundtruth.

0. run feat_superpixel.m

a. Prepare dataset and 3rd party softwares (OpenCV and VLFeat)

b. run startup_penn_fudan.m  
	
c. generate texture features (64 texton features for node, + 64 LAB color features = 128 dim features)

	- run generate_textures_pf.m (don't use too many images for generating textons, do need more than 6GB usually)

d. generate Pb features (for edge features, optional)

	- run generate_PB.m

e. generate the rest of the features (in data_penn_fudan/parts_spseg_features/)

	- compile generate_features.cpp (NOTE : This code requires OpenCV)
		g++ generate_features.cpp -o generate_features `pkg-config --libs --cflags opencv` -g
	- run drive_feats.pl.  This is just a wrapper to generate_features.cpp.  This wrapper may be easier to work with since generate_features.cpp requires many input parameters.

f. run saveNodeFeatures2mat.m to convert superpixel features to .mat file (in data_penn_fudan/feat_superpixels/)

g. run preProData_XXX.m to get allData (stored in feat_superpixels/)
